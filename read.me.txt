What can you change in the plugin ? Not many, and which may change is already configured with the best option.
You can change only the constant defined in _SELF_SHORT_URL_MODE, other changes are not necessary and not recommended.
Valid values are described below:

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Define Shortening Mode with "_SELF_SHORT_URL_MODE" ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# 0 - is integer mode = real Post ID from wordpress database 
# 1 - Base 16 Mode - the hexadecimal mode, meaning the post ID of wordpress is converted into base 16
# 2 - Extended Mode - Post ID value is transformed into letters and numbers, which is actually is base 36
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For integer: INTEGER
define('_SELF_SHORT_URL_MODE',0);

For HEXAZECIMAL
define('_SELF_SHORT_URL_MODE',1); 

Letters and Numbers (this is defaul mode, and the best)
define('_SELF_SHORT_URL_MODE',2);


ATENTION:
1. One of these files, "wp-config.php" or "index.php", must have write access - "index.php" is preferable for faster loading. Otherwise, shortened links will not work.
2. Disabling plugin does not mean the loss of links, they will continue to function until the plugin code from in wp-config.php or index.php will be manually removed.
3. Any other changes to the plugin can lead to malfunction or problems with the blog. 
4. Plugin programmer is not responsible for incompatibility with some blogs, or any version of WordPress.
5 these folders should not exist in root blog: /i/ or /h/ or /z/ and also, there should be no page with slug name "z", "h" or "i" ... in 99% of cases should not be any problem.
